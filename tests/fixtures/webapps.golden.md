# Introduction

With **Mini Apps** developers can use *JavaScript* to create **infinitely flexible interfaces** that can be launched right inside Telegram — and can completely replace **any website**.

Like bots, **Mini Apps** support [seamless authorization](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots#meet-seamless-web-bots), payments via third-party [payment providers](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) (with *Google Pay* and *Apple Pay* out of the box), delivering tailored push notifications to users, and [much more](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

# Designing Mini Apps



=== color-schemes | section | h4 | parent=designing-mini-apps ===
# Color Schemes

Mini Apps always receive data about the user's current **color theme** in real time, so you can adjust the appearance of your interfaces to match it. For example, when users switch between **Day and Night** modes or use various [custom themes](https://telegram.org/blog/protected-content-delete-by-date-and-more#global-chat-themes-on-android).

[video](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001257/12087/QNQUbIi864k.909800.mp4/8ea7adad7db407388e)

> [Jump to technical information](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#themeparams)

=== design-guidelines | section | h4 | parent=designing-mini-apps ===
# Design Guidelines

Telegram apps are known for being snappy, smooth and following a consistent cross-platform design. Your Mini App should ideally reflect these principles.

- All elements should be responsive and designed with a mobile-first approach.
- Interactive elements should mimic the style, behavior, and intent of UI components that already exist.
- All included animations should be smooth, ideally 60fps.
- All inputs and images should contain labels for accessibility purposes.
- The app should deliver a seamless experience by monitoring the [dynamic theme-based colors](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#color-schemes) provided by the API and using them accordingly.
- Ensure that the app’s interface respects the [safe area](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#safeareainset) and [content safe area](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#contentsafeareainset) to avoid overlapping with control elements, especially when using fullscreen mode.
- For Android devices, consider the additional information in the User-Agent (see [User-Agent details](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#additional-data-in-user-agent)) and adjust for the device’s performance class, minimizing animations and visual effects on low-performance devices to ensure smooth performance.

=== implementing-mini-apps | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Implementing Mini Apps

Telegram currently supports seven different ways of launching Mini Apps: the main Mini App from a [profile button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#launching-the-main-mini-app), from a [keyboard button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#keyboard-button-mini-apps), from an [inline button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#inline-button-mini-apps), from the [bot menu button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#launching-mini-apps-from-the-menu-button), via [inline mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#inline-mode-mini-apps), from a [direct link](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#direct-link-mini-apps) – and even from the [attachment menu](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#launching-mini-apps-from-the-attachment-menu).

[![Types of buttons](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001388/10b1a/IYpn0wWfggw.1156850/fd9a32baa81dcecbe4)](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001388/10b1a/IYpn0wWfggw.1156850/fd9a32baa81dcecbe4)

=== keyboard-button-mini-apps | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Keyboard Button Mini Apps

> **TL;DR:** Mini Apps launched from a **web_app** type [keyboard button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#keyboardbutton) can send data back to the bot in a *service message* using [Telegram.WebApp.sendData](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps). This makes it possible for the bot to produce a response without communicating with any external servers.

Users can interact with bots using [custom keyboards](https://core.telegram.org/bots#keyboards), [buttons under bot messages](https://core.telegram.org/bots#inline-keyboards-and-on-the-fly-updating), as well as by sending freeform **text messages** or any of the **attachment types** supported by Telegram: photos and videos, files, locations, contacts and polls. For even more flexibility, bots can utilize the full power of **HTML5** to create user-friendly input interfaces.

You can send a **web_app** type [KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#keyboardbutton) that opens a Mini App from the specified URL.

To transmit data from the user back to the bot, the Mini App can call the [Telegram.WebApp.sendData](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps) method. Data will be transmitted to the bot as a String in a service message. The bot can continue communicating with the user after receiving it.

**Good for:**

- **Сustom data input interfaces** (a personalized calendar for selecting dates; selecting data from a list with advanced search options; a randomizer that lets the user “spin a wheel” and chooses one of the available options, etc.)
- **Reusable components** that do not depend on a particular bot.

=== inline-button-mini-apps | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Inline Button Mini Apps

> **TL;DR:** For more interactive Mini Apps like [@DurgerKingBot](https://t.me/durgerkingbot), use a **web_app** type [Inline KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton), which gets basic user information and can be used to send a message on behalf of the user to the chat with the bot.

If receiving text data alone is insufficient or you need a more advanced and personalized interface, you can open a Mini App using a **web_app** type [Inline KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton).

From the button, a Mini App will open with the URL specified in the button. In addition to the user's [theme settings](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#color-schemes), it will receive basic user information (`ID`, `name`, `username`, `language_code`) and a unique identifier for the session, **query_id**, which allows messages on behalf of the user to be sent back to the bot.

The bot can call the Bot API method [answerWebAppQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answerwebappquery) to send an inline message from the user back to the bot and close the Mini App. After receiving the message, the bot can continue communicating with the user.

**Good for:**

- Fully-fledged web services and integrations of any kind.
- The use cases are effectively **unlimited**.

=== launching-mini-apps-from-the-menu-button | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Launching Mini Apps from the Menu Button

> **TL;DR:** Mini Apps can be launched from a customized menu button. This simply offers a quicker way to access the app and is otherwise **identical** to [launching a mini app from an inline button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#inline-button-mini-apps).

By default, chats with bots always show a convenient **menu button** that provides quick access to all listed [commands](https://core.telegram.org/bots#commands). With [Bot API 6.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog#april-16-2022), this button can be used to **launch a Mini App** instead.

[video](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001838/10fa2/WrJmkuIMan0.1217917.mp4/e25a5f31bc4e6493f7)

To configure the menu button, you must specify the text it should show and the Mini App URL. There are two ways to set these parameters:

- To customize the button for **all users**, use [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) (the `/setmenubutton` command or *Bot Settings > Menu Button*).
- To customize the button for both **all users** and **specific users**, use the [setChatMenuButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setchatmenubutton) method in the Bot API. For example, change the button text according to the user's language, or show links to different Mini Apps based on a user's settings in your bot.

Apart from this, Mini Apps opened via the menu button work in the exact same way as when [using inline buttons](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#inline-button-mini-apps).

> [@DurgerKingBot](https://t.me/durgerkingbot) allows launching its Mini App both from an inline button and from the menu button.

=== launching-the-main-mini-app | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Launching the main Mini App

> **TL;DR:** If your bot is a mini app, you can add a prominent **Launch app** button as well as high-quality demo videos and screenshots to the bot’s profile. To do this, go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and set up your bot's **Main Mini App**.

If your bot is a mini app, you can unlock a number of features that streamline and simplify the way in which users view and interact with it. To do this, go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and set up your bot's **Main Mini App**.

After setting a main mini app, you'll be able to upload detailed **media preview demos** to publicly highlight your app's key features on its profile. A **Launch app** button will also appear, allowing users to open your app directly from its profile. Bots that enabled a main mini app will be displayed in the *Apps* tab of the search for users who have launched them.

> Media previews support [multiple languages](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#mini-app-previews) – so you can upload **translated versions** of your previews that will be shown to users based on their **app language**.

A bot's **main Mini App** can also be opened in the current chat by direct link in the format `https://t.me/botusername?startapp`. If a non-empty *startapp* parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the *start_param* field and in the GET parameter *tgWebAppStartParam*.

**Examples**

`https://t.me/botusername?startapp`  
`https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command`  
`https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command&mode=compact`

In this mode, Mini Apps can use the *chat_type* and *chat_instance* parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for **concurrent** and **shared** usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps.

By default, the main Mini App opens to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) or by including the parameter `mode=compact` in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default.

**Good for:**

- Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap.
- Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context.
- The use cases are effectively **unlimited**.

> Successful bots which **enable** a main Mini App and **accept payments** in [Telegram Stars](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments-stars) may be featured in the Telegram [Mini App Store](https://t.me/BotNews/99). To increase the chances of being featured, we recommend uploading high-quality media showcasing your app on your bot's profile and following our [design guidelines](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#design-guidelines).

=== inline-mode-mini-apps | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Inline Mode Mini Apps

> **TL;DR:** Mini Apps launched via **web_app** type [InlineQueryResultsButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultsbutton) can be used anywhere in inline mode. Users can create content in a web interface and then seamlessly send it to the current chat via inline mode.

You can use the *button* parameter in the [answerInlineQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answerinlinequery) method to display a special 'Switch to Mini App' button either above or in place of the inline results. This button will **open a Mini App** from the specified URL. Once done, you can call the [Telegram.WebApp.switchInlineQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps) method to send the user back to inline mode.

Inline Mini Apps have **no access** to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to **inline mode** and actively pick a result.

**Good for:**

- Fully-fledged web services and integrations in inline mode.

=== direct-link-mini-apps | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Direct Link Mini Apps

> **TL;DR:** Mini App Bots can be launched from a direct link in any chat. They support a *startapp* parameter and are aware of the current chat context.

You can use direct links to **open a Mini App** directly in the current chat. If a non-empty *startapp* parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the *start_param* field and in the GET parameter *tgWebAppStartParam*.

In this mode, Mini Apps can use the *chat_type* and *chat_instance* parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for **concurrent** and **shared** usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps.

Mini Apps opened from a direct link have **no access** to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to **inline mode** and actively pick a result.

Starting from **Bot API 7.6**, by default, Mini Apps of this type open to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior by including the parameter `mode=compact` in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default.

**Examples**

`https://t.me/botusername/appname`  
`https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command`  
`https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command&mode=compact`

**Good for:**

- Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap.
- Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context.
- The use cases are effectively **unlimited**.

=== launching-mini-apps-from-the-attachment-menu | section | h4 | parent=implementing-mini-apps ===
# Launching Mini Apps from the Attachment Menu

> **TL;DR:** Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from any chat. To try this mode, open this [attachment menu link](https://t.me/durgerkingbot?startattach) for *@DurgerKingBot*, then use the ![Attach](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001085/2/E4hNXSNQimQ.2503/bf6ffcab3cb3afd43d) menu in **any type of chat**.

Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from **any type of chat**. You can configure in which types of chats your mini app can be started from the attachment menu (private, groups, supergroups or channels).

Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the [Telegram Ad Platform](https://promote.telegram.org/basics). However, **all bots** can use it in the [test server environment](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-bots-in-the-test-environment).

To enable this feature for your bot, open [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) [from an account on the test server](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-bots-in-the-test-environment) and send the `/setattach` command – or go to *Bot Settings > Configure Attachment Menu*. Then specify the URL that will be opened to launch the bot's Mini App via its icon in the attachment menu.

You can add a 'Settings' item to the context menu of your Mini App using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). When users select this option from the menu, your bot will receive a `settingsButtonClicked` event.

In addition to the user's [theme settings](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#color-schemes), the bot will receive basic user information (`ID`, `name`, `username`, `language_code`, `photo`), as well as public info about the chat partner (`ID`, `name`, `username`, `photo`) or the chat info (`ID`, `type`, `title`, `username`, `photo`) and a unique identifier for the web view session **query_id**, which allows messages of any type to be sent to the chat on behalf of the user that opened the bot.

The bot can call the Bot API method [answerWebAppQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answerwebappquery), which sends an inline message from the user via the bot to the chat where it was launched and closes the Mini App.

# Initializing Mini Apps

To connect your Mini App to the Telegram client, place the script [telegram-web-app.js](https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?63) in the `<head>` tag before any other scripts, using this code:

```
<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?63"></script>
```

Once the script is connected, a `window.Telegram.WebApp` object will become available with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| initData | String | A string with raw data transferred to the Mini App, convenient for [validating data](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app).<br>**WARNING:** [Validate data](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app) from this field before using it on the bot's server. |
| initDataUnsafe | [WebAppInitData](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#webappinitdata) | An object with input data transferred to the Mini App.<br>**WARNING:** Data from this field should not be trusted. You should only use data from *initData* on the bot's server and only after it has been [validated](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app). |
| version | String | The version of the Bot API available in the user's Telegram app. |
| platform | String | The name of the platform of the user's Telegram app. |
| colorScheme | String | The color scheme currently used in the Telegram app. Either “light” or “dark”.<br>Also available as the CSS variable `var(--tg-color-scheme)`. |
| themeParams | [ThemeParams](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#themeparams) | An object containing the current theme settings used in the Telegram app. |
| isActive **NEW** | Boolean | **Bot API 8.0+** *True*, if the Mini App is currently active. *False*, if the Mini App is minimized. |
| isExpanded | Boolean | *True*, if the Mini App is expanded to the maximum available height. False, if the Mini App occupies part of the screen and can be expanded to the full height using the **expand()** method. |

From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the **expand()** method. As the position of the Mini App changes, the current height value of the visible area will be updated in real time.<br><br>Please note that the refresh rate of this value is not sufficient to smoothly follow the lower border of the window. It should not be used to pin interface elements to the bottom of the visible area. It's more appropriate to use the value of the `viewportStableHeight` field for this purpose. |
| viewportStableHeight | Float | The height of the visible area of the Mini App in its last stable state. Also available in CSS as a variable `var(--tg-viewport-stable-height)`.<br><br>The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the **expand()** method. Unlike the value of `viewportHeight`, the value of `viewportStableHeight` does not change as the position of the Mini App changes with user gestures or during animations. The value of `viewportStableHeight` will be updated after all gestures and animations are completed and the Mini App reaches its final size.<br><br>*Note the [event](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#events-available-for-mini-apps) `viewportChanged` with the passed parameter `isStateStable=true`, which will allow you to track when the stable state of the height of the visible area changes.* |

Secure storage is suitable for storing tokens, secrets, authentication state, and other sensitive user-specific information. Each bot can store up to **10 items per user**.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| setItem(key, value[, callback]) | Function | **Bot API 9.0+** A method that stores a value in the device's secure storage using the specified key. If an optional *callback* parameter was passed, the *callback* function will be called. In case of an error, the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be *null* and the second argument will be a boolean indicating whether the value was stored. |
| getItem(key, callback) | Function | **Bot API 9.0+** A method that receives a value from the device's secure storage using the specified key. In case of an error, the *callback* function will be called and the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be *null* and the value will be passed as the second argument. If the key was not found, the second argument will be *null*, and the third argument will be a boolean indicating whether the key can be restored from the current device. |
| restoreItem(key[, callback]) | Function | **Bot API 9.0+** Attempts to restore a key that previously existed on the current device. When called, the user will be asked for permission to restore the value. If the user declines or an error occurs, the first argument in the *callback* will contain the error. If restored successfully, the first argument will be *null* and the second argument will contain the restored value. |
| removeItem(key[, callback]) | Function | **Bot API 9.0+** A method that removes a value from the device's secure storage using the specified key. If an optional *callback* parameter was passed, the *callback* function will be called. In case of an error, the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be *null* and the second argument will be a boolean indicating whether the value was removed. |
| clear([callback]) | Function | **Bot API 9.0+** A method that clears all keys previously stored by the bot in the device's secure storage. If an optional *callback* parameter was passed, the *callback* function will be called. In case of an error, the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be *null* and the second argument will be a boolean indicating whether all values were removed. |

All these methods return the [SecureStorage](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#securestorage) object, so they can be chained.

=== validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app | section | h4 | parent=initializing-mini-apps ===
# Validating data received via the Mini App

To validate data received via the Mini App, one should send the data from the *Telegram.WebApp.initData* field to the bot's backend. The data is a query string, which is composed of a series of field-value pairs.

You can verify the integrity of the data received by comparing the received *hash* parameter with the hexadecimal representation of the [HMAC-SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) signature of the **data-check-string** with the secret key, which is the [HMAC-SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) signature of the [bot's token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) with the constant string `WebAppData` used as a key.

**Data-check-string** is a chain of all received fields, sorted alphabetically, in the format `key=<value>` with a [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) character ('  
', 0x0A) used as separator – e.g., `'auth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'`.

The full check might look like:

```
data_check_string = ...
secret_key = HMAC_SHA256(<bot_token>, "WebAppData")
if (hex(HMAC_SHA256(data_check_string, secret_key)) == hash) {
  // data is from Telegram
}
```

To prevent the use of outdated data, you can additionally check the *auth_date* field, which contains a Unix timestamp of when it was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used on your server. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

=== validating-data-for-third-party-use | section | h4 | parent=initializing-mini-apps ===
# Validating data for Third-Party Use

**NEW** If you need to share the data with a third party, they can validate the data without requiring access to your [bot's token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token). Simply provide them with the data from the *Telegram.WebApp.initData* field and your *bot_id*.

The integrity of the data can be verified by validating the received *signature* parameter, which is the base64url-encoded representation of the [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) signature of the **data-check-string**. The verification is performed using the public key provided by Telegram.

**Data-check-string** is constructed as follows:  
1. Prepend the *bot_id*, followed by `:` and the constant string `WebAppData`.  
2. Add a [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) character (`'\n'`, 0x0A).  
3. Append all received fields (except *hash* and *signature*), sorted alphabetically, in the format `key=<value>`.  
4. Separate each key-value pair with a line feed character (`'\n'`, 0x0A).

**Example:**  
`'12345678:WebAppData\nauth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'`

The verification process might look like this:

```
data_check_string = ...
public_key = "<Telegram_public_key>"
if (Ed25519_verify(public_key, data_check_string, signature)) {
  // data is valid and originated from Telegram
}
```

> Telegram provides the following [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) public keys for signature verification:
> 
> **Test environment:** `40055058a4ee38156a06562e52eece92a771bcd8346a8c4615cb7376eddf72ec` (hex)  
> **Production:** `e7bf03a2fa4602af4580703d88dda5bb59f32ed8b02a56c187fe7d34caed242d` (hex)

To prevent the use of outdated data, the third party should additionally validate the *auth_date* field. This field contains a Unix timestamp indicating when the data was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

=== events-available-for-mini-apps | section | h4 | parent=initializing-mini-apps ===

=== adding-bots-to-the-attachment-menu | section | h4 | parent=initializing-mini-apps ===
# Adding Bots to the Attachment Menu

Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the [Telegram Ad Platform](https://promote.telegram.org/basics). However, **all bots** can use it in the [test server environment](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-bots-in-the-test-environment). Talk to Botfather on the test server to [set up the integration](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-bots-in-the-test-environment).

A special link is used to add bots to the attachment menu:

`https://t.me/botusername?startattach`  
or  
`https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command`

> For example, open this [attachment menu link](https://t.me/durgerkingbot?startattach) for *@DurgerKingBot*, then use the ![Attach](https://core.telegram.org/file/464001085/2/E4hNXSNQimQ.2503/bf6ffcab3cb3afd43d) menu in any **private chat**.

Opening the link prompts the user to add the bot to their attachment menu. If the bot has already been added, the attachment menu will open in the current chat and redirect to the bot there (if the link is opened from a 1-on-1 chat). If a non-empty *startattach* parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the *start_param* field and in the GET parameter *tgWebAppStartParam*.

The following link formats are also supported:

`https://t.me/username?attach=botusername`  
`https://t.me/username?attach=botusername&startattach=command`  
`https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername`  
`https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername&startattach=command`

These links open the Mini App in the attachment menu in the chat with a specific user. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. If a non-empty *startattach* parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the *start_param* field and in the GET parameter *tgWebAppStartParam*.

**Bot API 6.1+** supports a new link format:

`https://t.me/botusername?startattach&choose=users+bots`  
`https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command&choose=groups+channels`

Opening such a link prompts the user to choose a specific chat and opens the attachment menu in that chat. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. You can specify which types of chats the user will be able to choose from. It can be one or more of the following types: *users*, *bots*, *groups*, *channels* separated by a `+` sign. If a non-empty *startattach* parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the *start_param* field and in the GET parameter *tgWebAppStartParam*.

=== additional-data-in-user-agent | section | h4 | parent=initializing-mini-apps ===
# Additional Data in User-Agent

When the Mini App is running on Android, additional information is appended to the User-Agent string to provide more context about the app environment. This information includes the app version, device model, Android version, SDK version, and device performance class, formatted as follows:

```
Telegram-Android/{app_version} ({manufacturer} {model}; Android {android_version}; SDK {sdk_version}; {performance_class})
```

where:

- **{app_version}** is the version of the Telegram app (e.g., `11.3.3`),
- **{manufacturer} {model}** represents the device’s manufacturer and model (e.g., `Google sdk_gphone64_arm64`),
- **{android_version}** is the Android OS version running on the device (e.g., `14`),
- **{sdk_version}** indicates the Android SDK version (e.g., `34`),
- **{performance_class}** specifies the device performance class as `LOW`, `AVERAGE`, or `HIGH`, indicating the device's performance capacity.

> **Example**  
> `Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 14; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.5672.136 Mobile Safari/537.36 Telegram-Android/11.3.3 (Google sdk_gphone64_arm64; Android 14; SDK 34; LOW)`

We recommend using this information to optimize your Mini App based on the device's capabilities. For instance, you can adjust animations and visual effects in games on low-performance devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users, regardless of device specifications.

=== testing-mini-apps | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Testing Mini Apps



=== using-bots-in-the-test-environment | section | h4 | parent=testing-mini-apps ===
# Using bots in the test environment

To log in to the test environment, use either of the following:

- **iOS:** tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test.
- **Telegram Desktop:** open ☰ Settings > Shift + Alt + Right click ‘Add Account’ and select ‘Test Server’.
- **macOS:** click the Settings icon 10 times to open the Debug Menu, ⌘ + click ‘Add Account’ and log in via phone number.

The test environment is completely separate from the main environment, so you will need to create a **new user account** and a **new bot** with @BotFather.

After receiving your bot token, you can send requests to the Bot API in this format:

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/test/METHOD_NAME
```

> **Note:** When working with the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS to test your Mini App.

# General Questions



=== how-do-i-create-a-bot | section | h4 | parent=general-questions ===
# How do I create a bot?

Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills at computer programming. In order for a bot to work, set up a bot account with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather), then connect it to your backend server via our [API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.

=== i-39m-a-developer-where-can-i-find-some-examples | section | h4 | parent=general-questions ===
# I'm a developer. Where can I find some examples?

Here are two sample bots, both written in PHP:

- [Hello Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples/hellobot) demonstrates the basics of the Telegram bot API.
- [Simple Poll bot](https://github.com/kolar/telegram-poll-bot) is a more complete example, it supports both long-polling and Webhooks for updates.

> Many members of our community are building bots and publishing sources.  
> We're collecting them on [**this page »**](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples)

Ping us on [@BotSupport](https://telegram.me/botsupport) if you've built a bot and would like to share it with others.

=== will-you-add-x-to-the-bot-api | section | h4 | parent=general-questions ===
# Will you add X to the Bot API?

The bot API is still pretty young. There are many potential features to consider and implement. We'll be studying what people do with their bots for a while to see which directions will be most important for the platform.

All bot developers are welcome to share ideas for our Bot API with our [**@BotSupport**](https://telegram.me/botsupport) account.

=== what-messages-will-my-bot-get | section | h4 | parent=general-questions ===
# What messages will my bot get?

**1.** **All bots**, regardless of settings, will receive:

- All service messages.
- All messages from private chats with users.
- All messages from channels where they are a member.

**2.** **Bot admins** and bots with [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) **disabled** will receive all messages except messages sent by other bots.

**3.** Bots with [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) **enabled** will receive:

- Commands explicitly meant for them (e.g., /command@this_bot).
- General commands from users (e.g. /start) **if** the bot was the last bot to send a message to the group.
- Messages sent [via](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inline-mode) this bot.
- Replies to any messages implicitly or explicitly meant for this bot.

**Note** that each particular message can only be available to **one** privacy-enabled bot at a time, i.e., a reply to bot A containing an explicit command for bot B or sent via bot C will only be available to bot A. Replies have the highest priority.

=== why-doesn-39t-my-bot-see-messages-from-other-bots | section | h4 | parent=general-questions ===
# Why doesn't my bot see messages from other bots?

Bots talking to each other could potentially get stuck in unwelcome loops. To avoid this, we decided that bots will not be able to see messages from other bots regardless of mode.

=== getting-updates | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Getting Updates



=== how-do-i-get-updates | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# How do I get updates?

There are currently two ways of getting updates. You can either use [long polling](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) or [Webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook). Please note that it's **not** possible to get updates via long polling while an outgoing Webhook is set.

=== long-polling-gives-me-the-same-updates-again-and-again | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# Long polling gives me the same updates again and again!

The [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) method returns the earliest 100 unconfirmed updates. To confirm an update, use the *offset* parameter when calling getUpdates like this:

offset = update_id of last processed update + 1

All updates with *update_id* less than or equal to *offset* will be marked as confirmed on the server and will no longer be returned.

=== i-39m-having-problems-with-webhooks | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# I'm having problems with Webhooks.

If you've set up your webhook successfully, but are not getting any updates, please remember:

- You need a valid SSL certificate for webhooks to work.
- To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate using the *certificate* parameter in [setWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook). Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.
- Ports currently supported for Webhooks: **443**, **80**, **88**, **8443**.
- Wildcard certificates may not be supported.
- Redirects are not supported.
- CN must exactly match your domain.

> Please check out this new [**WEBHOOK GUIDE**](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks) to learn all there is to know about webhooks!

=== i-39m-having-trouble-with-my-self-signed-certificate | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# I'm having trouble with my self-signed certificate!

Please take a look at this [self-signed certificate guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots/self-signed) we made just for you. If you've read it and still have a question, ping us on botsupport.

=== how-can-i-make-sure-that-webhook-requests-are-coming-from-telegr | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# How can I make sure that Webhook requests are coming from Telegram?

If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL you give us, e.g. www.example.com/your_token. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.

=== how-can-i-make-requests-in-response-to-updates | section | h4 | parent=getting-updates ===
# How can I make requests in response to updates?

This is possible if you're using webhooks. The upside is that you need less requests, the downside — that in this case it's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.

Whenever you receive a webhook update, you have two options:

**1. Issue POST to https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/method**

[![Confirm and request](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140979/3/5p52TWl9X2o/5c6d684ee0d6a4399d)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140979/3/5p52TWl9X2o/5c6d684ee0d6a4399d)

**2. Reply directly and give method as JSON payload in the reply**

[![Reply with payload](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140266/2/vGxiVmENAos/6cffad00cbe72be7f2)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140266/2/vGxiVmENAos/6cffad00cbe72be7f2)

> You may also want to look at our sample [HelloBot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples/hellobot), it offers a PHP implementation of this.

=== handling-media | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Handling Media



=== how-do-i-download-files | section | h4 | parent=handling-media ===
# How do I download files?

Use the [getFile](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile) method. Please note that this will only work with files of up to 20 MB in size.

=== how-do-i-upload-a-large-file | section | h4 | parent=handling-media ===
# How do I upload a large file?

Bots can currently send files of any type of up to 50 MB in size, so yes, very large files won't work for now. Sorry. This limit may be changed in the future.

=== can-i-count-on-file-ids-to-be-persistent | section | h4 | parent=handling-media ===
# Can I count on file_ids to be persistent?

Yes, file_ids can be treated as persistent.

=== broadcasting-to-users | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Broadcasting to Users



=== my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this | section | h4 | parent=broadcasting-to-users ===
# My bot is hitting limits, how do I avoid this?

By default, bots are able to message their users **at no cost** – but have limitations on the number of messages they can broadcast in a single interval:

- In a single chat, avoid sending more than one message per second. We may allow short bursts that go over this limit, but eventually you'll begin receiving 429 errors.
- In a group, bots are not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute.
- For bulk notifications, bots are not able to broadcast more than about 30 messages per second, unless they enable [paid broadcasts](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-can-i-message-all-of-my-bot-39s-subscribers-at-once) to increase the limit.

=== how-can-i-message-all-of-my-bot-39s-subscribers-at-once | section | h4 | parent=broadcasting-to-users ===
# How can I message all of my bot's subscribers at once?

Enabling [paid broadcasts](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog#october-31-2024) in [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) allows a bot to broadcast up to **1000 messages per second**. Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 per second incurs a cost of **0.1 Stars per message**, paid with [Telegram Stars](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-stars) from the bot's balance. In order to enable this feature, a bot must have at least **10,000 Stars** on its balance and at least **10,000** monthly active users.

> Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.

If you do not wish to enable paid broadcasts, consider spreading them over longer intervals (e.g. 8-12 hours) to avoid hitting the limit. The API will not allow bulk notifications to more than ~30 users per second – if you go over that, you'll start getting 429 errors.

=== getting-started | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Getting Started

Telegram offers a [compact tool](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-the-telegram-login-library) to quickly add Telegram login buttons to your interface. You can also directly access our library's [JS API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#available-methods).

For mobile developers, we also provide ready-to-use **[Native SDKs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#native-sdks)** for iOS and Android.

Alternatively, Telegram supports the standard [OpenID Connect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC%29>) protocol. This allows you to integrate Telegram authentication into your application using any OIDC-compatible library or authentication platform (e.g., Keycloak, Authentik, Auth0 etc.).

Our implementation follows the standard [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) with **PKCE** support.

> For an in-depth understanding of the general OIDC flow, please refer to the [OpenID Foundation's Developer Guide](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works).

=== tldr | type | h4 | parent=getting-started ===
# TL;DR

- **[Set up a bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#setting-up-a-bot)** to represent your application.
- **[Register your Allowed URLs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#registering-your-allowed-urls)** via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and obtain your Client ID and Secret.

=== setting-up-a-bot | section | h4 | parent=getting-started ===
# Setting up a bot

To use Telegram Login, you'll need a [**Telegram bot**](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) to represent your application.

We strongly recommend that the **profile picture** of the bot corresponds with your website's logo, and that the bot's **name** reflects that connection. Users will see a confirmation box similar to the one below when logging in:

[![Login confirmation box](https://core.telegram.org/file/400780400680/1/LQAYyWKJXy0.260963.png/8fe2cdf47d8a182740)](https://core.telegram.org/file/400780400680/1/LQAYyWKJXy0.260963.png/8fe2cdf47d8a182740)

> Users are much more likely to authorize your app if the bot has a name and logo they recognize and expect. Official services can also [apply for verification](https://telegram.org/verify) from Telegram or [third parties](https://telegram.org/verify#third-party-verification) for greater transparency.

=== registering-your-allowed-urls | section | h4 | parent=getting-started ===
# Registering your Allowed URLs

Once you have chosen a bot, open the [**@BotFather**](https://t.me/botfather?startapp) mini app and navigate to **Bot Settings > Web Login**.

Add all **Allowed URLs** for your application. This includes the website origins where you embed the login widget (e.g., `https://example.com`) and specific redirect URIs for your OIDC flow (e.g., `https://example.com/auth/callback`). You can register multiple URLs to support different domains or endpoints.

In this section, [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) will also display your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values securely – you will need them to configure your OIDC client.

> **Important:** For security reasons, Telegram will only process logins or redirect users using your pre-registered URLs.

Alternatively, you can interact with the library using the following JS methods:

=== available-methods | section | h4 | parent=using-the-telegram-login-library ===
# Available Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Telegram.Login.init(InitOptions, callback)` | Initialize the SDK and register an auth callback. |
| `Telegram.Login.open([callback])` | Open the login popup using the initialized options. |
| `Telegram.Login.auth(InitOptions, callback)` | Open the login popup with explicit options. |

=== initoptions | type | h4 | parent=using-the-telegram-login-library ===
# InitOptions

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `client_id` | number | Your bot’s Client ID provided by [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). |
| `request_access` | array(`phone` \| `write`) | *Optional.* Ask for a phone number / permission to message the user. |
| `lang` | string | *Optional.* UI language code (e.g., `en`, `es`). |
| `nonce` | string | *Optional.* Server-generated random string to be included in the resulting `id_token` to prevent replay attacks. |

=== callback-data | section | h4 | parent=using-the-telegram-login-library ===
# Callback Data

When the login flow completes, the callback may receive either a success payload (user data) or an error.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id_token` | string | An OIDC JWT token containing user claims. **Important: [Verify the validity of ID token server-side](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-id-tokens)** |
| `user` | [UserData](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#user-data-structure) | Decoded `id_token`, containing the requested user info. |
| `error` | string | Error description. |

> **Important:** The `telegram-login.js` library relies on communicating with a popup window to complete the authentication flow. If your website serves the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` HTTP header, this cross-window communication will be blocked and the login process will fail. To ensure the JavaScript library functions correctly, you must either remove this header or use a more permissive policy, such as `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`.

---

=== native-sdks | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Native SDKs

If you are building a native mobile application, Telegram provides dedicated SDKs to streamline the login experience on iOS and Android devices, bypassing the need for web-based views.

- **[Telegram Login for iOS](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/telegram-login-ios)**  
  A native Swift package for integrating Telegram authentication into your iOS or iPadOS applications.
- **[Telegram Login for Android](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/telegram-login-android)**  
  A native Android library allowing you to seamlessly authenticate users within your Kotlin or Java Android applications.

> **Note:** Complete setup guides, installation instructions, and usage examples for each platform can be found directly in the README files of their respective GitHub repositories.

---

=== openid-connect | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# OpenID Connect

If you are using an OIDC-compatible library or identity broker, you can use the standard configuration values below.

**Discovery Document URL**

```
https://oauth.telegram.org/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

**Client Configuration**

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Client ID** | The Client ID provided by BotFather |
| **Client Secret** | The Client Secret provided by BotFather |
| **Response Type** | `code` |
| **PKCE** | Recommended (S256) |

=== available-scopes | section | h4 | parent=openid-connect ===
# Available Scopes

You can request specific permissions when initiating authorization. The `openid` scope is required.

| Scope | Description | Claims Returned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openid` | **Required.** Returns the user's unique identifier and auth timestamp. | `sub`, `iss`, `iat`, `exp` |
| `profile` | User's basic info: name, username, and profile photo URL. | `name`, `preferred_username`, `picture` |
| `phone` | User's verified **phone number**. Requires user consent. | `phone_number` |
| `telegram:bot_access` | Allows your bot to send direct messages to the user after login. | — |

=== user-data-structure | section | h4 | parent=openid-connect ===
# User Data Structure

All requested user information is returned directly in the **ID token**. After successful authentication, the decoded ID token will look like this:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://oauth.telegram.org",
  "aud": "123456789",
  "sub": "1234123412341234123",
  "iat": 1700000000,
  "exp": 1700003600,
  "id": 987654321,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "preferred_username": "johndoe",
  "picture": "https://cdn4.telesco.pe/file...",
  "phone_number": "971577777777"
}
```

> Note that Telegram does not currently provide a separate `UserInfo` endpoint. However, some OIDC libraries may expect this endpoint by default, and you may need to **configure them** to skip a separate `userinfo` request.

---

=== manual-implementation | section | h3 | parent=- ===
# Manual Implementation

If you are integrating the OIDC flow manually without a library, use the endpoints and flow details below.

=== endpoints | type | h4 | parent=manual-implementation ===
# Endpoints

- **Authorization:** `https://oauth.telegram.org/auth`
- **Token:** `https://oauth.telegram.org/token`
- **Keys (JWKS):** `https://oauth.telegram.org/.well-known/jwks.json`

=== initiate-authorization | section | h4 | parent=manual-implementation ===
# Initiate Authorization

Direct the user to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters. This URL must be opened in the user's browser.

```http
GET https://oauth.telegram.org/auth?
    client_id=<YOUR_BOT_ID>&
    redirect_uri=<YOUR_CALLBACK_URL>&
    response_type=code&
    scope=openid%20profile%20phone&
    state=<RANDOM_STRING>&
    code_challenge=<PKCE_CHALLENGE>&
    code_challenge_method=S256
```

- **client_id**: Client ID provided by BotFather.
- **state**: A random string generated by your backend to prevent CSRF.
- **code_challenge**: Base64URL-encoded SHA256 hash of your code verifier (PKCE).

=== exchange-code-for-tokens | section | h4 | parent=manual-implementation ===
# Exchange Code for Tokens

If the user approves the login, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri` with a `code` parameter. Exchange this code for an access token and ID token by making a server-side POST request.

This request requires **Basic Authorization** using your Client ID and Client Secret (`base64(client_id:client_secret)`).

```http
POST https://oauth.telegram.org/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic <BASE64_CREDENTIALS>

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>&
redirect_uri=<YOUR_CALLBACK_URL>&
client_id=<YOUR_BOT_ID>&
code_verifier=<PKCE_VERIFIER>
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJ..."
}
```

=== validating-id-tokens | section | h4 | parent=manual-implementation ===
# Validating ID Tokens

The `id_token` is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). Before trusting the user data inside, you **must** validate the signature:

1. **Fetch Keys:** specific public keys from the [JWKS endpoint](https://oauth.telegram.org/.well-known/jwks.json).
2. **Verify Signature:** Ensure the token was signed by Telegram.
3. **Verify Claims:** Check that `iss` is `https://oauth.telegram.org`, `aud` matches your Bot ID, and the token has not expired (`exp`).

---

> Once you have established a connection with the user, you can optionally use your **linked bot** to provide services **directly in the chat interface** via the [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots), or seamlessly offer your **entire web application inside Telegram** using [Mini Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps).
